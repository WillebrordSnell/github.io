Research</h2><ol><li><p>they have learned not only how to find information, but how to evaluate it, then how to report it clearly and accurately.(ofen, they challenge misinformation.) more than ever, those skills are essential for success in any profession.</p></li><li><p>we must be candid, though: doing research carefully and reporting it clearly are hard work, consisting of many tasks, often competing for your attention at the same time. and no matter how carefully you plan, research follows a crooked path, taking unexpected turns, sometimes up blind alleys, even looping back on itself. as complex as that process is, we will work though it step-by-step so that you can see how its parts work together.when you can manage its parts,you can manage the often intimidating wholee and look forward to doing more research with greater confidence.</p></li><li><p>yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence.</p></li><li><p>if you&#39;re preparing to do a research project not because you want to but because it&#39;s been assigned, you might think that it is just make-work and treat it as an empty exercise. we hope you won&#39;t. done well, your project prepares you to join the oldest and most esteemed of human conversations, one conducted for millennia among philosophers, engineers, biologiists, social scientists, theologians, not to mention CEOs, lawyers, investment managers——the list is endless.</p></li><li><p>right now, if you are a beginner, you may feel that the conversation is one-sided, that you have to listen more than you can speak because you have little to contribute. if you are a student, you may feel that you have only one reader: you teacher. all that may be true, for the moment. but at some point, you will join a conversation that, at its best, can help you and your community free us from ignorance, prejudice, and then half-baked ideas that so many charlatans try to impose on us. it is no exaggeration to say that, maybe not today or tomorrow but one day, the research you do and the arguments you make using it can improve if not the whole world, then at least you corner of it.</p></li><li><p>we write not just to share our work, but to improve it before we do.</p></li><li><p>expreienced researchers fist write just to remember what they&#39;ve read. when you don&#39;t take notes on what you read, you&#39;re likely to forget or, worse, misremember it.</p></li><li><p>writing is to see larger patterns in what you read. for example: <em>I want to use these claims from Wong,but her arguments is undercut by Smith&#39;s data. when I put them side by side, I see that Smith ignores this last part of Wong&#39;s argument.Aha! if I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on Wong more clearly</em>. that&#39;s why careful researchers never put off writing until they&#39;ve gathered all the data they need: they write from the strat of their projects to help them assemble their information in new ways.</p></li><li><p>writing is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you&#39;ll see what you really can think.</p></li><li><p>in short, we write to remember more accurately, understander better, and evaluate what we think more objectively.(and as you will discover, the more you write, the better you read.)</p></li><li><p>you will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your reads&#39; inevitable and critical questions:How have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it&#39;s relevant? What ideas have you considered but reject?</p></li><li><p>all researchers, indlucing us, can recall moments when in writing to meet their readers&#39; expectations, they found a flaw or blunder in their thinking or even discovered a new insight that escaped them in fist draft written for themselves.</p></li><li><p>we wish we could tell you how to balance your belief in the worth of your project with the need to accommodate the demands of teachers and colleagues, but we cannot. if you believe in what you&#39;re doing and cannot find anyone else who shares your beliefs, all you can do is put your head down and press on. with our admiration.</p></li><li><p>those roles are worth thinking about from the beginning, before you write a word. if you ingore or miscast your readrers, you&#39;ll leave so many traces of mistake in your early drafts that you won&#39;t easily fix them in the final one.</p></li><li><p>too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. yours to say whether I&#39;ve found enough to give me a good grade. do that and your turn you project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. worse, you cast yourself in a role excatly opposite that of a true researcher.</p></li><li><p>in true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. when you do research, you learned something that others don&#39;t know. so when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn&#39;t know it but needs to and yourself ass someone who will give her reason to want to know it. you must imagine a relationship that gose beyond here are some facts I&#39;ve dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. are they enough of the right ones?</p></li><li><p>you establish your side of the relationship with your readres when you adopt one of those three roles— I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.and you must understand what they want and what they are in return willing and able to do for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>your teachers except you to report not just what you find, but what you can do with it.</strong></p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id="动物农场" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#动物农场" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 动物农场</h2><ol><li><p>“同志们，你们已经听说昨夜我做了一个奇怪的梦。但是，关于那个梦我待会儿再谈。我有别的事儿要说。同志们，我恐怕没有好多个月跟你们在一起了，在我去世之前，我觉得自己有义务把我所获得的智慧传递给你们。我这辈子活得够长的了，当我独自躺在圈里的时候，曾有很多时间静心思考，我认为自己可以说：我懂得了在这片土地上生活，而且懂得不比如今活着的任何动物差。我想要对你们讲的就是这档子事儿。”</p><p>“那么，同志们，我们过的究竟是什么日子呢？我们还是实话实说吧：我们的生命是悲惨的，劳苦的，和短促的。我们生了下来，供给我们的食物仅仅够维持我们的躯体里始终有一口气，我们当中那些能活下来的，就被强迫干活，直到精疲力尽；一旦我们的食用价值到了尽头，我们立马就会遭到骇人听闻的残酷杀戮。在英格兰，动物只要满了一岁，便再也不知道什么叫做快乐或者休闲。在英格兰，动物是没有自由的。动物的一生只有受苦受难受奴役的份儿，这是明摆着的事实。”</p><p>“那么这会不会纯粹是自然条件决定的呢？莫非由于我们这里地穷土薄，没法让在此居住的生灵过上体面地生活呢？不， 同志们，一千个不，一万个不！英格兰的土壤是肥沃的，气候是适宜的，哪怕需要养活的生灵数量远远大于如今在此居住的动物总数，也有能力为他们提供丰饶富足的食物。单单我们这一个农场就养得起十二匹马、二十条牛、几百只羊，并且能让他们全部活得及舒服又有尊严——那简直是我们目前无法想象的。可是我们又为什么总是活得这样窝窝囊囊、可怜巴巴呢？那是因为我们的劳动成果几乎全部被人类从我们身边偷走了。同志们，这就是我们所有问题的答案。它可以归结为简简单单的一个字——人。人是我们仅有的真正仇敌。只要把人赶下台，造成食不果腹和过度劳累的根本原因便可永远铲除。”</p><p>“所有生灵中唯独人是光消费不生产的。人不会产奶，不会下蛋；人力气太小，拉不动犁；人跑地不够快，逮不着兔子。然而，人却是所有动物的主子。人使唤动物干活，却只给动物少的不能再少的一点回报，仅仅为了不让他们饿死，而其余的部分悉数被人据为己有。我们的劳作耕耘着土壤，我们的粪便给土壤施肥，然而我们中的任何一个，除了自己身上的一张皮之外，什么都捞不到。我且问问眼前的几条奶牛，过去的一年里头，你们产了几千几万加仑奶呀？这些本该用于哺育健壮牛犊的奶都到哪儿去了？这些奶每一滴都让我们的敌人喝掉了。还有你们这些母鸡，过去一年你们总共下了多少蛋，这些蛋张建有多少孵成了小鸡？其余的蛋全部都卖到市场上去，给琼斯他们带来了钱。还有你，紫苜蓿(mù xù),你生过四只小马，有了他们你原本可以老有所依，老有所乐，可是他们都在哪儿啊？他们每一只都是刚满一岁就给卖掉的，从此以后哪一只你都休想再见到啦。你前后生育过四胎，在地里一贯勤劳苦干，可是这一切又换来了什么回报？除了你那份紧巴巴的饲料配额和一间马棚，你还得到过什么？”</p><p>“然而，即使是我们这种悲惨的生命，也不让走到顺乎自然的尽头。就我自己而言，我并不抱怨，因为我的运气算是不错的。我活了一十二年，我的孩子共有四百多。这才是一头猪顺乎自然的一生。可是没有动物最终能逃脱挨残酷一刀的下场。就说眼下坐在我们前面的那几只肥小猪吧，不出一年，你们一个个都将在屠宰面前没命地惨叫。如此可怕的厄运一定会临到我们大家头上——奶牛也罢，猪也罢，鸡也罢，羊也罢，一只也逃不了。即使是马和狗的命，也好不到哪儿去。以你拳击手为例，琼斯立刻就把你卖给受老弱病马的贩子，让他先宰了你，再把你煮熟了喂猎狐犬。至于狗么，等他们老掉了牙，琼斯会在他们脖子栓一块砖，把他们就近沉入随便哪个水塘”</p><p>“同志们，可见我们这种生活的万恶之源完全在于人类的专制统治，这不是清清楚楚、明明白白的吗？只要拜托人的统治，我们的劳动成果就是我们自己的了。几乎一夜之间我们就能变得富足、自由。那么，我们该怎么干呢？毫无疑问，必须白天黑夜连着干，全身心投入工作，为把人类拉下马！同志们，我要传达你们的信息，那就是：造反！我不知道那场造反运动什么时候来临，可能过一个星期，也可能要过一百年，但我知道，就像看到我脚下踩着干草一样确信无疑，正义迟早必定得到伸张。同志们，你们的余生已为日无多，这一点要始终铭记在心！最最要紧的是，必须把我带来的这个消息传给你们的后代，这样代代相传就能把斗争继续进行下去，直至赢得胜利”</p><p>“要记住，同志们，你们的决心千万不能动摇。切不可让花言巧语把你们引入歧途。要是有谁对你说，人和动物有共同利益，人富即动物富，那都是谎话，绝对听不得。人只为自己谋利益，不为其他任何动物谋利益。我们动物之间在斗争中必须完全团结一致，建立真正的同志情谊。所有的人都是我们的仇敌。所有的动物都是同志”</p></li><li><p>“要说的我几乎都说了。我只是再次提醒大家，永远牢记你们肩负的责任，对待人类及其举止行为，必须持敌视态度。凡是两条腿行走的，那就是敌人。凡是四条腿行走或者长翅膀的，那就是朋友。同样要记住，在反抗人类的斗争进程中，我们切不可落到效仿人类的地步。即使你们征服了人类，也不得把他们的恶习继承下来。动物任何时候都不准住在房子里，或睡在床上，或身穿衣服，或喝酒，或吸烟，或接触钱币，或参与买卖。人类的所有习惯都是邪恶的。最最重要的是，动物不得欺压自己的同类。不分强弱，无论贤愚，我们都是兄弟。凡动物都不可杀任何别的动物。凡动物一律平等。”</p><p>“同志们，现在我要把我昨夜我做梦的事告诉你们。我没法像你们描述那场梦的情景。那是关于将来人类消亡以后这片土地会是什么情形的一个梦。但它令我想起我久已忘怀的一些事情。好多年以前，那时我还是一头小猪，我母亲和另外几头母猪经常唱一支老歌，她们只会哼那歌的曲调，不会唱词儿，只知道开头的六个字。小时候我也学会了哼那曲调，但它从我记忆中消失已经很久很久了。不料昨夜，它又回到我的梦中来了。可还有更绝的，那支歌的词儿也回来了——我相信那正是很久很久以前动物们所唱的歌词，后来失传已有好多好多年代。同志们，现在我要把那支歌长给你们听。我老了，嗓子早已沙哑；不过，等我把曲调教给你们以后，你们自己可以更好地唱给自己听。歌的名儿叫《英格兰的生灵》”</p></li><li><p>就这样，几乎没等到他们弄清楚究竟是怎么回事，造反就已经大功告成：琼斯被扫地出门，庄园农场是动物们的了。最初的几分钟，动物们简直无法相信他们的运气会这样好。他们的第一个行动是全体出动沿着农场的地界绕场奔跑，仿佛要完全肯定再也没有一个人躲在场内的什么地方；然后他们又跑回农场的居住区，把可恨的琼斯统治遗留下来的一切痕迹统统扫除干净。马厩尽头的挽具房被撞开；马嚼子、鼻环、狗链、琼斯先生过去常用来阉割猪羊的那些凶残的刀子，一股脑全给抛到井下去。缰绳、笼头、眼罩、固定在头上套在鼻子的饲料袋，被扔进点燃在院子里的垃圾堆。鞭子的下场也一样。当动物们看到鞭子在火焰中燃烧起来时，全都高兴得又蹦又跳。逢到赶集的日子通常扎在马鬃毛和马尾巴上的缎带。也被雪球扔进了火堆。</p><p>“缎带和衣服一样，”他说，“应当被视为人类的标志。所有的动物都应当一丝不挂。”</p><p>拳击手一听到这话，便摘下他夏天戴着防苍蝇钻进耳朵的一顶小草帽，把它跟其他东西一样扔到火堆上去。</p><p>不多一会儿工夫，动物们已把会令他们想起琼斯先生的一切东西全部消灭。</p></li><li><p>“同志们！”吱嘎尖声喊道。“难道你们认为，我们猪这样做是自私自利和享受特权的一种表现？我希望你们不这样想。我们有许多同志其实讨厌牛奶和苹果。我自己就讨厌他们。我们食用这些东西的唯一目的就是保持我们的身体健康。牛奶和苹果含有一口猪保持身体健康不可或缺的物质。我们猪是脑力劳动者。本农场的整个管理组织部门全都依靠我们。我们白天黑夜都在守护着你们的福祉。正是为了你们，我们才喝那些牛奶，吃那些苹果。要是我们这些猪无法恪(kè)尽厥责，你们可知道会发生什么？琼斯将会回来！是的，琼斯将会回来！同志们，想必……”吱嘎几乎在用恳求的语调呼吁，同时身子跳来跳去，尾巴摇个不停，“……想必你们当中没有愿意看到琼斯回来吧”</p><p>如果说在某件事情上动物们的态度毫无争议的话，那就是他们都不愿意琼斯回来。如果问题以这样的角度摆到他们面前，那么，动物们再也无话可说了。让猪们保持良好的健康状态，其重要性是再显而易见不过的了。于是，大家无须继续争论便同意，让牛奶和被风吹落的苹果再加上成熟苹果收成中的大头，归猪们独享。</p></li><li><p>雪球并不认为建造风车是一项困难重重的工程，他坚持认为一切都可以在一年内完成。他断言，到那时大量的劳动力可以节省下来，动物们每周只需工作三天。相反，拿破仑却辩称，目前当务之急是增加粮食生产，倘若把时间浪费在风车上头，他们都得饿死。于是动物在不同口号下分成两大派：一派的口号是“拥护雪球和每周三天工作制”；另一派的口号是“拥护拿破仑和满槽粮”。本杰明是不属于任何一派的唯一动物。他既不相信粮食会更加丰富，也不相信风车能节省劳动力。他认为，要风车也罢，不要风车也罢，日子一直是这么过的，往后还得怎么过——也就是说，过得很遭。</p></li><li><p>那一年动物们自始至终像奴隶一般在干活。但他们干得舒心；他们舍得出力，不怕牺牲，清楚地意识到自己做的一切无不为了他们的福祉，也是为了他们同类及其后代的福祉，而不是为了一帮不劳而获、专事偷盗的人。</p></li><li><p>一个星期天上午，动物们聚集到一起接受任务。拿破仑宣布，他决定实行一项新政策。从今往后，动物农场将同附近别的农场进行贸易往来——当然不是为了达到任何商业上的目的，而只是为了获得某些迫切需要的材料。他说，建造风车的需要必须压倒其他一切需要。为此他打算卖掉一垛干草和部分当年的小麦收成，以后如果还需要花钱，就得靠卖鸡蛋弥补缺口，反正鸡蛋在维林敦一直有销路。拿破仑说，母鸡应当愉快地承受这样的牺牲，作为她们自己对建造风车的贡献。</p><p>动物们再次意识到一种不可名状的不自在感觉。永远别跟人类打交道，永远不要参与买卖交易，永远不要使用货币——自从琼斯被驱逐后，在第一次胜利的碰头会上最早通过的一些决议中，不是明明有那几条的嘛？所有的动物都没有忘记当初通过这些决议时的情形，或者说，至少他们认为自己还没有忘记。曾经反对拿破仑取消碰头会的四头青少年猪，此刻怯生生地提高嗓门似有话说，但他们一下子被那些猛犬凶巴巴地喝住，只得噤若寒蝉。正当其时，绵羊们照例开始咩咩地大唱其“四条腿好，两条腿坏”，片刻的尴尬就这样掩盖了过去。最后，拿破仑举起他的一只前蹄示意噤声，并宣布他已经做好一切安排。将来无须任何动物去干这件大家显然最不愿意干的事——跟人类接触。他打算把全副重担都压在自己肩上。住在维林敦的一位律师温珀先生，已同意充当动物农场与外部世界之间的中介，他每星期一上午会到农场来接受指示。拿破仑结束发言时照例喊了一声“动物农场万岁！”，在动物们唱完《英格兰的生灵》后宣布散会。</p></li><li><p>温珀先生按照事先的约定每周一来到农场。他神情诡秘，身材矮小，两鬓蓄有络腮胡子，作为一名律师业务规模很小，但足够精明，能够早于其他任何人认识到动物农场需要一名经纪人，而佣金也并非微不足道。动物们怀着一种类乎忧惧的心理状态观察此人来了又走，走了又来，并且尽可能避开他。虽然如此，动物们看到拿破仑四足着地竟在给用两条腿站立的温珀下命令，一种自豪感便在他们心中油然而生，也使他们对这项新举措的抵触情绪有所缓解。动物与人类的关系现在跟过去已不完全一样。人类对动物农场的敌视并不因后者欣欣向荣而稍有减弱；相反，人类比以往任何时候更加敌视这个农场。每一个人都抱定一种信念：这个农场迟早要破产，而最没有疑问的一件事便是造风车必将以失败告终。人们在酒馆里见面时，每每通过画图表相互论证，风车的垮台早已注定，或者就是造了起来也永远运转不了。然而，动物们正在有效地管理自己的事务这一点，使人们违背自己的意愿对之产生了一定的敬意。这方面的一个迹象，乃是人们提到动物农场时开始使用其正式名称，不再故意强调它原先叫做庄园农场。人们还放弃了支持琼斯的立场，而后者对于夺回他的农场也已不存什么希望，干脆住到本郡内的异地他乡去了。除了通过温珀，目下在动物农场与外界之间尚无接触，但不时有传闻提到，拿破仑即将跟狐苑的皮尔金顿先生或撬棍地的弗雷德里克先生达成一项确定无疑的商务协议——但绝对不是跟这二人同时成交，这一点已经被注意到了。</p></li><li><p>人们从仇视的立场出发，故意表示不相信风车毁于雪球的暗中破坏。他们说，风车的倒塌是因为墙太薄了。动物们知道这并不是问题的症结所在。虽然如此，但还是决定把墙砌成三英尺厚，而不是原先的一英尺半，足足加厚一倍，这就意味着采集石块的数量必须大大增加。有很长一段时间采矿场里满是被风吹成的雪堆，什么也干不了。在随后出现的干冷日子里工作稍有进展，但这是十分残酷的苦活，动物们对之已不像过去那样充满希望。他们总是觉得很冷，往往还饥寒交迫。只有拳击手和紫苜蓿从不丧失信心。吱嘎发表过多次论奉献之快乐和劳工之神圣的精彩讲演，然而其他动物倒是从拳击手的无穷精力和他一如既往地表示“我会更加努力工作！”的那一声嘶鸣中得到较多鼓舞。</p></li><li><p>某个星期天上午，吱嘎宣布母鸡（她们恰好进来照例准备产卵）必须上缴她们生下的蛋。拿破仑通过温珀已签下一份每周提供四百枚鸡蛋的合同。出售鸡蛋所得款项将用于购进足够数量的谷类食物，使农场得以维持到夏天来临，那时情况将会好转。</p><p>母鸡们一听到这项决定，顿时大起恐慌，叫个不停。她们已预先接受吹风，说可能不得不做出这种牺牲，但她们并不相信这等事真会发生。她们刚刚准备好各自的一窝蛋以便开春孵育，所以纷纷表示抗议，认为现在把蛋取走简直就是谋杀。自打琼斯给撵走以后，还是头一回发生有点儿像一次造反的风波。由三只正当青春的米诺卡小黑鸡带头，母鸡们下定决心要努力不让拿破仑的愿望实现。她们采用的办法是飞到椽子上去在那儿产卵，结果鸡蛋都掉到地上打碎了。拿破仑做出的反应迅捷而又无情。他吩咐停发母鸡们的口粮，并且下令道，任何动物胆敢私自接济母鸡者，即使只给一粒玉米，都将被处死，并由护卫队的猛犬负责执行上述命令。母鸡们共坚持了五天，最后投降并回到她们的巢箱中去。这段时间内共死了九只母鸡。她们的尸体被埋在果园里，公开的说法是她们死于球虫病。温珀对这一事件一无所知，鸡蛋按时交货，一辆带篷的生鲜运货车每周一次来农场把鸡蛋拉走。</p></li><li><p>开春之初，突然发现一个情况令大家惶恐不安。雪球在夜间经常悄悄潜入农场！动物们紧张得在圈栏里睡不着觉。据说他每晚都在夜幕的掩护下溜进来干种种坏事。他偷吃谷物，倒翻奶桶，打破鸡蛋，践踏苗床，啃去果树皮。不管什么时候什么事情乱了套，大家马上把它归罪于雪球，这已经成为惯例。要是有一扇窗玻璃打破了，或者一根排水管堵塞了，肯定有谁会说那是雪球夜里来干的。当饲料棚的钥匙丢失的时候，全农场众口一词咬定准是雪球把钥匙扔到井里去了。甚至那把搁错了地方的钥匙过了一阵子在一口袋粗磨面底下被找到以后，大家依旧坚信那是雪球所为，这可真够怪的。母牛们不约而同地声称，雪球曾摸进她们的棚栏，趁她们睡着时挤了她们的奶。那个冬季大老鼠为害甚烈，据说他们跟雪球也是同伙。</p></li><li><p>这一整年，动物们干的活甚至比上一年更辛苦。重新建造风车，墙体的厚度比原先增加一倍，并且要在规定期限内完成，而农场的常规工作还得照做，这样的劳动强度可不是闹着玩儿的。有时候动物们觉得他们劳动的时间比琼斯时代更长，吃的却不比那时好。星期天上午，吱嘎总要用蹄子夹着长长一条纸，向动物们宣读大串大串的数字，表明各档粮食的产量分别增长百分之二百，百分之三百或百分之五百，因不同情况而异。动物们认为没有理由不相信他，何况他们再也记不清造反之前究竟是怎么个状况。反正有些日子他们还是感到，他们宁愿少听些数字，多得到些吃的。</p></li><li><p>但是，如果说有这样那样的艰难困苦必须忍受的话，它们也被这样一个事实部分抵消掉了：现今的生活具有比过去较多的尊严。歌声多了，讲演多了，列队游行多了。拿破仑下令每周必须举行一次名为自发性游行的活动，目的在于庆祝动物农场的斗争和胜利。所谓的自发性游行，就是动物们在指定时间放下他们的工作，编成军事化队形绕着农场的地界行进，由猪们领头，随后是马，然后是母牛，其后是绵羊，再后是家禽。狗走在队伍的两侧，而位于所有动物之首的是拿破仑的黑色小公鸡。拳击手和紫苜蓿总是合抬着标有蹄子和头角的绿色旗帜，上面还有“拿破仑同志万岁！”的字样。游行之后是为颂扬拿破仑而作的诗歌朗诵和吱嘎的演说，其中不乏最新的粮食增产数据，有时也来一下鸣枪作伴奏。绵羊们是自发性游行最热心的拥护者，如果有谁发发牢骚（只要猪或狗不在近处，个别动物有时会这样做的），说这纯粹是浪费时间，让大家在寒风中站上好半天云云，那么绵羊们肯定会以一片价来势汹汹的咩咩大合唱“四条腿好，两条腿坏！”令抱怨者闭嘴。不过，一般说来，动物们还是喜欢这类庆祝活动的。说到底他们乐意听这样的话：他们是自己真正的主人，他们干的活都是为了他们自己的福祉，等等。由于歌声嘹亮，游行队伍浩浩荡荡，吱嘎提供的一大串数字为农场增光，加之猎枪频频鸣响，小公鸡喔喔喔啼得欢畅，旗帜在猎猎声中迎风飘扬——由于身在这一切之中，动物们有可能忘却他们的肚子是空的，至少部分时间可能忘却。</p></li><li><p>现在的农场比往昔较为富裕，生产组织得也较好；它的面积有所扩大，增加了从皮尔金顿那儿购得的两块地。风车最终还是圆满建成了，农场拥有属于自己的一台脱粒机和一台捆草机，此外还新盖了各种不同的建筑物。温珀给自己购置了一辆双轮轻便马车。不过，风车到头来却并没有用于发电。它被用来碾磨谷物，收益颇丰。动物们正在努力建造另一座风车；据说等这第二座建成后将要安装发电机组。不过，当初雪球教动物们梦想过上的奢华生活——有电灯照明和冷热水齐全的厩舍，一周三天工作制——再也不谈了。拿破仑指责这种想法是与动物主义的精神背道而驰的。他说，真真正正的幸福就在于勤奋的工作和俭朴的生活。</p></li><li><p>不知怎么的，虽然农场比过去富了，可是动物们自己似乎并没有什么富裕起来的迹象——当然，猪和狗不在此例。也许，部分原因就在于有那么多的猪和那么多的狗。倒不是说这两种动物不劳动——这是他们的做派。问题在于，就像吱嘎从来不厌其烦地解释的那样，在农场的管理和组织方面有干不完的工作。这些工作中有许多属于其他动物过于无知而理解不了的。例如，吱嘎曾告诉他们，猪不得不每天耗费大量劳动在叫做“档案”、“报告”、“议事录”、“备忘录”的神秘事务上头。那都是大张大张的纸，必须在上面密密麻麻地写上字，一旦这些纸写满了字，就会放到炉子里烧掉。这对农场的福祉都是至关重要的，吱嘎说。但迄今为止，猪也罢，狗也罢，都还没有用他们自己的劳动生产过任何食物；而他们的数量却非常之多，他们的胃口又始终非常之好。</p><p>至于其他动物，据他们所知，他们的生活还一直是老样子。他们普遍吃不饱，睡干草，喝池塘水，干农活；冬天他们苦于寒冷，夏天受苍蝇骚扰。有时他们中年龄大些的，会去搜索他们模糊的记忆，试图就这样一个问题做出判断：在早先造反的日子里，那会儿琼斯被赶走还不太久，当时的日子是比现在好，还是比现在差。他们记不起来了。他们没有任何东西可以拿来同当前的生活做比较，因为他们没有任何参照的依据，除非以吱嘎的长长一大串一大串数字为准，而这些数字一贯表明任何事物都是越来越好，越来越好。动物们发现这个问题没法儿解决；他们现在没工夫思考这些事情。只有老本杰明表示自己漫长一生的每一个细节他都记得起来，也知道事情从来没有、也永远不会大大好于过去或大大不如过去——反正饥饿、辛苦和失望是生活的不变法则，他如是说。</p></li><li><p>皮尔金顿先生说，能感到很长一个时期以来的不信任和误会现已告终，这对他来说是皆大欢喜的缘由——他相信对在座的其他各位来说亦然如此。曾经有一段时间——虽然他或在座的任何一位都不认同这种态度——但确实曾有一段时间，尊敬的动物农场几位业主遭到来自他们的人类邻居的……他不愿说敌视，但或许可以说是某种程度的猜疑。不幸的事件时有发生，错误的观念被普遍接受。当时觉得，一家由猪当业主和经营管理的农场的存在，总有些不太正常，会对周边邻居产生一种不安定的影响。为数极多的农场主未做调查研究便认定，这样的农场里主宰一切的必然是无法无天、恣意胡为的歪风邪气。这些农场主十分忧虑他们自己的动物乃至他们的人类雇员会受到影响。但所有这一切疑虑如今均已消除。今天他和他的几位朋友一起来动物农场参观访问，亲眼考察了这里的每一寸土地，他们发现了什么呢？不光操作规程是最现代的，而且工作纪律严明，到处井然有序，这些对于任何地方的农场主都堪为楷模。动物农场的低等动物比郡内任何动物干的活更多，而消耗的饲料却更少——他相信自己这样说没错。确实，他和他的同行参观者们今天看到的很多东西，他们打算马上引进到自己的农场里去。<br> 他说，在发表自己这番感想的末尾，他要再一次强调，过去存在于动物农场与它邻居之间的友好感情应该继续留存下去。猪与人之间过去没有，也没有必要产生任何利害冲突。他们努力奋斗的目标和面临的困难是相同的。劳工问题在任何地方不都是一样的吗？说到这里，皮尔金顿先生显然有意向大家抛出一句精心准备好的俏皮话，然而有一瞬间他自己越想越觉得可笑，以致话也说不出来。他呛了好一阵子，在这期间他那呈多级台阶状的下巴转成了紫色，呛过以后，他总算说出了口：“你们有你们的低等动物需要对付，”他说，“我们有我们的下层阶级需要摆平！”这句妙语一出，举座为之笑得前俯后仰；于是皮尔金顿先生就他在动物农场观察到的食品定量低、工作时间长以及绝无纪律松弛现象再一次向猪们表示祝贺。</p></li><li><p>和拿破仑所有的发言一样，这次讲话也很短，而且直奔主题。他说，他对于误会误解的时期终于结束也感到很高兴。在一个长时期内有流言在传播——他有理由认为是敌人恶意散播的——说他自己以及他的同事们的观点含有某种颠覆性，甚至革命性的内容。外界认为他们图谋煽动附近几家农场的动物起来造反。没有比这种谣言离事实真相更远的了！拿破仑和他的同事们的唯一愿望，现在和过去都是同他们的邻居和睦共处，保持正常的商务关系。他补充说，他有幸负责监管的这个农场，是一个合作社性质的企业。由他亲自保管的产权证书属于猪们共有。</p><p>他说他不信旧的猜疑还会残存下来，但前不久农场在规章制度方面还是做了若干变更，这些举措应该会收到进一步推动互信的效果。到目前为止，农场的动物们有一个颇为愚蠢的惯例，就是互相称呼“同志”。这个称呼必须禁止使用。另外还有一条非常奇怪的旧规，其起因已无从查考，那就是每星期日早晨必须列队走过钉在花园内木柱上的一个公猪头颅。这一陋规也将取消，那个骷髅头已经被掩埋。来宾们可能已经看到有一面绿色旗帜飘扬在旗杆顶上。如果看到了，他们或许会留意原先标在旗帜上面的白色蹄角现在已被撤去。今后它将是一面素色的绿旗。</p></li></ol></div><!----><footer
