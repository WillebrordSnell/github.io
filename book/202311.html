Why do you think it's relevant? What ideas have you considered but reject? all researchers, indlucing us, can recall moments when in writing to meet their readers' expectations, they found a flaw or blunder in their thinking or even discovered a new insight that escaped them in fist draft written for themselves. we wish we could tell you how to balance your belief in the worth of your project with the need to accommodate the demands of teachers and colleagues, but we cannot. if you believe in what you're doing and cannot find anyone else who shares your beliefs, all you can do is put your head down and press on. with our admiration. those roles are worth thinking about from the beginning, before you write a word. if you ingore or miscast your readrers, you'll leave so many traces of mistake in your early drafts that you won't easily fix them in the final one. too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. yours to say whether I've found enough to give me a good grade. do that and your turn you project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. worse, you cast yourself in a role excatly opposite that of a true researcher. in true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. when you do research, you learned something that others don't know. so when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn't know it but needs to and yourself ass someone who will give her reason to want to know it. you must imagine a relationship that gose beyond here are some facts I've dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. are they enough of the right ones? you establish your side of the relationship with your readres when you adopt one of those three roles— I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.and you must understand what they want and what they are in return willing and able to do for you. your teachers except you to report not just what you find, but what you can do with it. These scholars have invited you to talk about your specialty: the social history of zeppelin travel in the 1930s. They don’t want you just to amuse them with new facts (though they’ll be happy if you&nbsp;do) or to help them do something (though they’d be pleased if you got them consulting work with True- to- Life Films). They want you to use whatever new facts you have to help them better understand the social history of zeppelin travel or, better still, of lighter- than- air culture in general. Because these lighter- than- air scholars are intensely committed to finding the Truth about zeppelins, you know they expect you to be objective, rigorously logical, and able to examine every issue from all sides. You also know that if you don’t nail down your facts, they’ll hammer you during the question period and if you don’t have good answers, slice you up afterward over the wine and cheese, not just to be contentious or even nasty (though some will be), but to get as close as they can to the Truth about zeppelins in the 1930s. If you offer new data, like Great- Uncle Otto’s photos, letter, and menu, they’ll be glad to see them, but they’ll want to know why they matter and might even question their authenticity Think about your readers from the start, knowing that you’ll understand them better as you work through your project.

Research</h2><ol><li><p>they have learned not only how to find information, but how to evaluate it, then how to report it clearly and accurately.(ofen, they challenge misinformation.) more than ever, those skills are essential for success in any profession.</p></li><li><p>we must be candid, though: doing research carefully and reporting it clearly are hard work, consisting of many tasks, often competing for your attention at the same time. and no matter how carefully you plan, research follows a crooked path, taking unexpected turns, sometimes up blind alleys, even looping back on itself. as complex as that process is, we will work though it step-by-step so that you can see how its parts work together.when you can manage its parts,you can manage the often intimidating wholee and look forward to doing more research with greater confidence.</p></li><li><p>yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence.</p></li><li><p>if you&#39;re preparing to do a research project not because you want to but because it&#39;s been assigned, you might think that it is just make-work and treat it as an empty exercise. we hope you won&#39;t. done well, your project prepares you to join the oldest and most esteemed of human conversations, one conducted for millennia among philosophers, engineers, biologiists, social scientists, theologians, not to mention CEOs, lawyers, investment managers——the list is endless.</p></li><li><p>right now, if you are a beginner, you may feel that the conversation is one-sided, that you have to listen more than you can speak because you have little to contribute. if you are a student, you may feel that you have only one reader: you teacher. all that may be true, for the moment. but at some point, you will join a conversation that, at its best, can help you and your community free us from ignorance, prejudice, and then half-baked ideas that so many charlatans try to impose on us. it is no exaggeration to say that, maybe not today or tomorrow but one day, the research you do and the arguments you make using it can improve if not the whole world, then at least you corner of it.</p></li><li><p>we write not just to share our work, but to improve it before we do.</p></li><li><p>expreienced researchers fist write just to remember what they&#39;ve read. when you don&#39;t take notes on what you read, you&#39;re likely to forget or, worse, misremember it.</p></li><li><p>writing is to see larger patterns in what you read. for example: <em>I want to use these claims from Wong,but her arguments is undercut by Smith&#39;s data. when I put them side by side, I see that Smith ignores this last part of Wong&#39;s argument.Aha! if I introduce it with this part from Brunelli, I can focus on Wong more clearly</em>. that&#39;s why careful researchers never put off writing until they&#39;ve gathered all the data they need: they write from the strat of their projects to help them assemble their information in new ways.</p></li><li><p>writing is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you&#39;ll see what you really can think.</p></li><li><p>in short, we write to remember more accurately, understander better, and evaluate what we think more objectively.(and as you will discover, the more you write, the better you read.)</p></li><li><p>you will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your reads&#39; inevitable and critical questions:How have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it&#39;s relevant? What ideas have you considered but reject?</p></li><li><p>all researchers, indlucing us, can recall moments when in writing to meet their readers&#39; expectations, they found a flaw or blunder in their thinking or even discovered a new insight that escaped them in fist draft written for themselves.</p></li><li><p>we wish we could tell you how to balance your belief in the worth of your project with the need to accommodate the demands of teachers and colleagues, but we cannot. if you believe in what you&#39;re doing and cannot find anyone else who shares your beliefs, all you can do is put your head down and press on. with our admiration.</p></li><li><p>those roles are worth thinking about from the beginning, before you write a word. if you ingore or miscast your readrers, you&#39;ll leave so many traces of mistake in your early drafts that you won&#39;t easily fix them in the final one.</p></li><li><p>too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. yours to say whether I&#39;ve found enough to give me a good grade. do that and your turn you project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. worse, you cast yourself in a role excatly opposite that of a true researcher.</p></li><li><p>in true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. when you do research, you learned something that others don&#39;t know. so when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn&#39;t know it but needs to and yourself ass someone who will give her reason to want to know it. you must imagine a relationship that gose beyond here are some facts I&#39;ve dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. are they enough of the right ones?</p></li><li><p>you establish your side of the relationship with your readres when you adopt one of those three roles— I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.and you must understand what they want and what they are in return willing and able to do for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>your teachers except you to report not just what you find, but what you can do with it.</strong></p></li><li><p>These scholars have invited you to talk about your specialty: the social history of zeppelin travel in the 1930s. They don’t want you just to amuse them with new facts (though they’ll be happy if you do) or to help them do something (though they’d be pleased if you got them consulting work with True- to- Life Films). They want you to use whatever new facts you have to help them better understand the social history of zeppelin travel or, better still, of lighter- than- air culture in general.</p><p>Because these lighter- than- air scholars are intensely committed to finding the Truth about zeppelins, you know they expect you to be objective, rigorously logical, and able to examine every issue from all sides. You also know that if you don’t nail down your facts, they’ll hammer you during the question period and if you don’t have good answers, slice you up afterward over the wine and cheese, not just to be contentious or even nasty (though some will be), but to get as close as they can to the Truth about zeppelins in the 1930s. If you offer new data, like Great- Uncle Otto’s photos, letter, and menu, they’ll be glad to see them, but they’ll want to know why they matter and might even question their authenticity</p></li><li><p>Think about your readers from the start, knowing that you’ll understand them better as you work through your project. Answer these questions early on, then revisit them when you start planning and again when you revise.</p><ul><li>Who will read my paper?</li><li>What do they expect me to do?</li></ul></li></ol><h2

动物农场</h2><ol><li><p>“同志们，你们已经听说昨夜我做了一个奇怪的梦。但是，关于那个梦我待会儿再谈。我有别的事儿要说。同志们，我恐怕没有好多个月跟你们在一起了，在我去世之前，我觉得自己有义务把我所获得的智慧传递给你们。我这辈子活得够长的了，当我独自躺在圈里的时候，曾有很多时间静心思考，我认为自己可以说：我懂得了在这片土地上生活，而且懂得不比如今活着的任何动物差。我想要对你们讲的就是这档子事儿。”</p><p>“那么，同志们，我们过的究竟是什么日子呢？我们还是实话实说吧：我们的生命是悲惨的，劳苦的，和短促的。我们生了下来，供给我们的食物仅仅够维持我们的躯体里始终有一口气，我们当中那些能活下来的，就被强迫干活，直到精疲力尽；一旦我们的食用价值到了尽头，我们立马就会遭到骇人听闻的残酷杀戮。在英格兰，动物只要满了一岁，便再也不知道什么叫做快乐或者休闲。在英格兰，动物是没有自由的。动物的一生只有受苦受难受奴役的份儿，这是明摆着的事实。”</p><p>“那么这会不会纯粹是自然条件决定的呢？莫非由于我们这里地穷土薄，没法让在此居住的生灵过上体面地生活呢？不， 同志们，一千个不，一万个不！英格兰的土壤是肥沃的，气候是适宜的，哪怕需要养活的生灵数量远远大于如今在此居住的动物总数，也有能力为他们提供丰饶富足的食物。单单我们这一个农场就养得起十二匹马、二十条牛、几百只羊，并且能让他们全部活得及舒服又有尊严——那简直是我们目前无法想象的。可是我们又为什么总是活得这样窝窝囊囊、可怜巴巴呢？那是因为我们的劳动成果几乎全部被人类从我们身边偷走了。同志们，这就是我们所有问题的答案。它可以归结为简简单单的一个字——人。人是我们仅有的真正仇敌。只要把人赶下台，造成食不果腹和过度劳累的根本原因便可永远铲除。”</p><p>“所有生灵中唯独人是光消费不生产的。人不会产奶，不会下蛋；人力气太小，拉不动犁；人跑地不够快，逮不着兔子。然而，人却是所有动物的主子。人使唤动物干活，却只给动物少的不能再少的一点回报，仅仅为了不让他们饿死，而其余的部分悉数被人据为己有。我们的劳作耕耘着土壤，我们的粪便给土壤施肥，然而我们中的任何一个，除了自己身上的一张皮之外，什么都捞不到。我且问问眼前的几条奶牛，过去的一年里头，你们产了几千几万加仑奶呀？这些本该用于哺育健壮牛犊的奶都到哪儿去了？这些奶每一滴都让我们的敌人喝掉了。还有你们这些母鸡，过去一年你们总共下了多少蛋，这些蛋张建有多少孵成了小鸡？其余的蛋全部都卖到市场上去，给琼斯他们带来了钱。还有你，紫苜蓿(mù xù),你生过四只小马，有了他们你原本可以老有所依，老有所乐，可是他们都在哪儿啊？他们每一只都是刚满一岁就给卖掉的，从此以后哪一只你都休想再见到啦。你前后生育过四胎，在地里一贯勤劳苦干，可是这一切又换来了什么回报？除了你那份紧巴巴的饲料配额和一间马棚，你还得到过什么？”</p><p>“然而，即使是我们这种悲惨的生命，也不让走到顺乎自然的尽头。就我自己而言，我并不抱怨，因为我的运气算是不错的。我活了一十二年，我的孩子共有四百多。这才是一头猪顺乎自然的一生。可是没有动物最终能逃脱挨残酷一刀的下场。就说眼下坐在我们前面的那几只肥小猪吧，不出一年，你们一个个都将在屠宰面前没命地惨叫。如此可怕的厄运一定会临到我们大家头上——奶牛也罢，猪也罢，鸡也罢，羊也罢，一只也逃不了。即使是马和狗的命，也好不到哪儿去。以你拳击手为例，琼斯立刻就把你卖给受老弱病马的贩子，让他先宰了你，再把你煮熟了喂猎狐犬。至于狗么，等他们老掉了牙，琼斯会在他们脖子栓一块砖，把他们就近沉入随便哪个水塘”</p><p>“同志们，可见我们这种生活的万恶之源完全在于人类的专制统治，这不是清清楚楚、明明白白的吗？只要拜托人的统治，我们的劳动成果就是我们自己的了。几乎一夜之间我们就能变得富足、自由。那么，我们该怎么干呢？毫无疑问，必须白天黑夜连着干，全身心投入工作，为把人类拉下马！同志们，我要传达你们的信息，那就是：造反！我不知道那场造反运动什么时候来临，可能过一个星期，也可能要过一百年，但我知道，就像看到我脚下踩着干草一样确信无疑，正义迟早必定得到伸张。同志们，你们的余生已为日无多，这一点要始终铭记在心！最最要紧的是，必须把我带来的这个消息传给你们的后代，这样代代相传就能把斗争继续进行下去，直至赢得胜利”</p><p>“要记住，同志们，你们的决心千万不能动摇。切不可让花言巧语把你们引入歧途。要是有谁对你说，人和动物有共同利益，人富即动物富，那都是谎话，绝对听不得。人只为自己谋利益，不为其他任何动物谋利益。我们动物之间在斗争中必须完全团结一致，建立真正的同志情谊。所有的人都是我们的仇敌。所有的动物都是同志”</p></li><li><p>“要说的我几乎都说了。我只是再次提醒大家，永远牢记你们肩负的责任，对待人类及其举止行为，必须持敌视态度。凡是两条腿行走的，那就是敌人。凡是四条腿行走或者长翅膀的，那就是朋友。同样要记住，在反抗人类的斗争进程中，我们切不可落到效仿人类的地步。即使你们征服了人类，也不得把他们的恶习继承下来。动物任何时候都不准住在房子里，或睡在床上，或身穿衣服，或喝酒，或吸烟，或接触钱币，或参与买卖。人类的所有习惯都是邪恶的。最最重要的是，动物不得欺压自己的同类。不分强弱，无论贤愚，我们都是兄弟。凡动物都不可杀任何别的动物。凡动物一律平等。”</p><p>“同志们，现在我要把我昨夜我做梦的事告诉你们。我没法像你们描述那场梦的情景。那是关于将来人类消亡以后这片土地会是什么情形的一个梦。但它令我想起我久已忘怀的一些事情。好多年以前，那时我还是一头小猪，我母亲和另外几头母猪经常唱一支老歌，她们只会哼那歌的曲调，不会唱词儿，只知道开头的六个字。小时候我也学会了哼那曲调，但它从我记忆中消失已经很久很久了。不料昨夜，它又回到我的梦中来了。可还有更绝的，那支歌的词儿也回来了——我相信那正是很久很久以前动物们所唱的歌词，后来失传已有好多好多年代。同志们，现在我要把那支歌长给你们听。我老了，嗓子早已沙哑；不过，等我把曲调教给你们以后，你们自己可以更好地唱给自己听。歌的名儿叫《英格兰的生灵》”</p></li><li><p>就这样，几乎没等到他们弄清楚究竟是怎么回事，造反就已经大功告成：琼斯被扫地出门，庄园农场是动物们的了。最初的几分钟，动物们简直无法相信他们的运气会这样好。他们的第一个行动是全体出动沿着农场的地界绕场奔跑，仿佛要完全肯定再也没有一个人躲在场内的什么地方；然后他们又跑回农场的居住区，把可恨的琼斯统治遗留下来的一切痕迹统统扫除干净。马厩尽头的挽具房被撞开；马嚼子、鼻环、狗链、琼斯先生过去常用来阉割猪羊的那些凶残的刀子，一股脑全给抛到井下去。缰绳、笼头、眼罩、固定在头上套在鼻子的饲料袋，被扔进点燃在院子里的垃圾堆。鞭子的下场也一样。当动物们看到鞭子在火焰中燃烧起来时，全都高兴得又蹦又跳。逢到赶集的日子通常扎在马鬃毛和马尾巴上的缎带。也被雪球扔进了火堆。</p><p>“缎带和衣服一样，”他说，“应当被视为人类的标志。所有的动物都应当一丝不挂。”</p><p>拳击手一听到这话，便摘下他夏天戴着防苍蝇钻进耳朵的一顶小草帽，把它跟其他东西一样扔到火堆上去。</p><p>不多一会儿工夫，动物们已把会令他们想起琼斯先生的一切东西全部消灭。</p></li><li><p>“同志们！”吱嘎尖声喊道。“难道你们认为，我们猪这样做是自私自利和享受特权的一种表现？我希望你们不这样想。我们有许多同志其实讨厌牛奶和苹果。我自己就讨厌他们。我们食用这些东西的唯一目的就是保持我们的身体健康。牛奶和苹果含有一口猪保持身体健康不可或缺的物质。我们猪是脑力劳动者。本农场的整个管理组织部门全都依靠我们。我们白天黑夜都在守护着你们的福祉。正是为了你们，我们才喝那些牛奶，吃那些苹果。要是我们这些猪无法恪(kè)尽厥责，你们可知道会发生什么？琼斯将会回来！是的，琼斯将会回来！同志们，想必……”吱嘎几乎在用恳求的语调呼吁，同时身子跳来跳去，尾巴摇个不停，“……想必你们当中没有愿意看到琼斯回来吧”</p><p>如果说在某件事情上动物们的态度毫无争议的话，那就是他们都不愿意琼斯回来。如果问题以这样的角度摆到他们面前，那么，动物们再也无话可说了。让猪们保持良好的健康状态，其重要性是再显而易见不过的了。于是，大家无须继续争论便同意，让牛奶和被风吹落的苹果再加上成熟苹果收成中的大头，归猪们独享。</p></li><li><p>雪球并不认为建造风车是一项困难重重的工程，他坚持认为一切都可以在一年内完成。他断言，到那时大量的劳动力可以节省下来，动物们每周只需工作三天。相反，拿破仑却辩称，目前当务之急是增加粮食生产，倘若把时间浪费在风车上头，他们都得饿死。于是动物在不同口号下分成两大派：一派的口号是“拥护雪球和每周三天工作制”；另一派的口号是“拥护拿破仑和满槽粮”。本杰明是不属于任何一派的唯一动物。他既不相信粮食会更加丰富，也不相信风车能节省劳动力。他认为，要风车也罢，不要风车也罢，日子一直是这么过的，往后还得怎么过——也就是说，过得很遭。</p></li><li><p>那一年动物们自始至终像奴隶一般在干活。但他们干得舒心；他们舍得出力，不怕牺牲，清楚地意识到自己做的一切无不为了他们的福祉，也是为了他们同类及其后代的福祉，而不是为了一帮不劳而获、专事偷盗的人。</p></li><li><p>一个星期天上午，动物们聚集到一起接受任务。拿破仑宣布，他决定实行一项新政策。从今往后，动物农场将同附近别的农场进行贸易往来——当然不是为了达到任何商业上的目的，而只是为了获得某些迫切需要的材料。他说，建造风车的需要必须压倒其他一切需要。为此他打算卖掉一垛干草和部分当年的小麦收成，以后如果还需要花钱，就得靠卖鸡蛋弥补缺口，反正鸡蛋在维林敦一直有销路。拿破仑说，母鸡应当愉快地承受这样的牺牲，作为她们自己对建造风车的贡献。</p><p>动物们再次意识到一种不可名状的不自在感觉。永远别跟人类打交道，永远不要参与买卖交易，永远不要使用货币——自从琼斯被驱逐后，在第一次胜利的碰头会上最早通过的一些决议中，不是明明有那几条的嘛？所有的动物都没有忘记当初通过这些决议时的情形，或者说，至少他们认为自己还没有忘记。曾经反对拿破仑取消碰头会的四头青少年猪，此刻怯生生地提高嗓门似有话说，但他们一下子被那些猛犬凶巴巴地喝住，只得噤若寒蝉。正当其时，绵羊们照例开始咩咩地大唱其“四条腿好，两条腿坏”，片刻的尴尬就这样掩盖了过去。最后，拿破仑举起他的一只前蹄示意噤声，并宣布他已经做好一切安排。将来无须任何动物去干这件大家显然最不愿意干的事——跟人类接触。他打算把全副重担都压在自己肩上。住在维林敦的一位律师温珀先生，已同意充当动物农场与外部世界之间的中介，他每星期一上午会到农场来接受指示。拿破仑结束发言时照例喊了一声“动物农场万岁！”，在动物们唱完《英格兰的生灵》后宣布散会。</p></li><li><p>温珀先生按照事先的约定每周一来到农场。他神情诡秘，身材矮小，两鬓蓄有络腮胡子，作为一名律师业务规模很小，但足够精明，能够早于其他任何人认识到动物农场需要一名经纪人，而佣金也并非微不足道。动物们怀着一种类乎忧惧的心理状态观察此人来了又走，走了又来，并且尽可能避开他。虽然如此，动物们看到拿破仑四足着地竟在给用两条腿站立的温珀下命令，一种自豪感便在他们心中油然而生，也使他们对这项新举措的抵触情绪有所缓解。动物与人类的关系现在跟过去已不完全一样。人类对动物农场的敌视并不因后者欣欣向荣而稍有减弱；相反，人类比以往任何时候更加敌视这个农场。每一个人都抱定一种信念：这个农场迟早要破产，而最没有疑问的一件事便是造风车必将以失败告终。人们在酒馆里见面时，每每通过画图表相互论证，风车的垮台早已注定，或者就是造了起来也永远运转不了。然而，动物们正在有效地管理自己的事务这一点，使人们违背自己的意愿对之产生了一定的敬意。这方面的一个迹象，乃是人们提到动物农场时开始使用其正式名称，不再故意强调它原先叫做庄园农场。人们还放弃了支持琼斯的立场，而后者对于夺回他的农场也已不存什么希望，干脆住到本郡内的异地他乡去了。除了通过温珀，目下在动物农场与外界之间尚无接触，但不时有传闻提到，拿破仑即将跟狐苑的皮尔金顿先生或撬棍地的弗雷德里克先生达成一项确定无疑的商务协议——但绝对不是跟这二人同时成交，这一点已经被注意到了。</p></li><li><p>人们从仇视的立场出发，故意表示不相信风车毁于雪球的暗中破坏。他们说，风车的倒塌是因为墙太薄了。动物们知道这并不是问题的症结所在。虽然如此，但还是决定把墙砌成三英尺厚，而不是原先的一英尺半，足足加厚一倍，这就意味着采集石块的数量必须大大增加。有很长一段时间采矿场里满是被风吹成的雪堆，什么也干不了。在随后出现的干冷日子里工作稍有进展，但这是十分残酷的苦活，动物们对之已不像过去那样充满希望。他们总是觉得很冷，往往还饥寒交迫。只有拳击手和紫苜蓿从不丧失信心。吱嘎发表过多次论奉献之快乐和劳工之神圣的精彩讲演，然而其他动物倒是从拳击手的无穷精力和他一如既往地表示“我会更加努力工作！”的那一声嘶鸣中得到较多鼓舞。</p></li><li><p>某个星期天上午，吱嘎宣布母鸡（她们恰好进来照例准备产卵）必须上缴她们生下的蛋。拿破仑通过温珀已签下一份每周提供四百枚鸡蛋的合同。出售鸡蛋所得款项将用于购进足够数量的谷类食物，使农场得以维持到夏天来临，那时情况将会好转。</p><p>母鸡们一听到这项决定，顿时大起恐慌，叫个不停。她们已预先接受吹风，说可能不得不做出这种牺牲，但她们并不相信这等事真会发生。她们刚刚准备好各自的一窝蛋以便开春孵育，所以纷纷表示抗议，认为现在把蛋取走简直就是谋杀。自打琼斯给撵走以后，还是头一回发生有点儿像一次造反的风波。由三只正当青春的米诺卡小黑鸡带头，母鸡们下定决心要努力不让拿破仑的愿望实现。她们采用的办法是飞到椽子上去在那儿产卵，结果鸡蛋都掉到地上打碎了。拿破仑做出的反应迅捷而又无情。他吩咐停发母鸡们的口粮，并且下令道，任何动物胆敢私自接济母鸡者，即使只给一粒玉米，都将被处死，并由护卫队的猛犬负责执行上述命令。母鸡们共坚持了五天，最后投降并回到她们的巢箱中去。这段时间内共死了九只母鸡。她们的尸体被埋在果园里，公开的说法是她们死于球虫病。温珀对这一事件一无所知，鸡蛋按时交货，一辆带篷的生鲜运货车每周一次来农场把鸡蛋拉走。</p></li><li><p>开春之初，突然发现一个情况令大家惶恐不安。雪球在夜间经常悄悄潜入农场！动物们紧张得在圈栏里睡不着觉。据说他每晚都在夜幕的掩护下溜进来干种种坏事。他偷吃谷物，倒翻奶桶，打破鸡蛋，践踏苗床，啃去果树皮。不管什么时候什么事情乱了套，大家马上把它归罪于雪球，这已经成为惯例。要是有一扇窗玻璃打破了，或者一根排水管堵塞了，肯定有谁会说那是雪球夜里来干的。当饲料棚的钥匙丢失的时候，全农场众口一词咬定准是雪球把钥匙扔到井里去了。甚至那把搁错了地方的钥匙过了一阵子在一口袋粗磨面底下被找到以后，大家依旧坚信那是雪球所为，这可真够怪的。母牛们不约而同地声称，雪球曾摸进她们的棚栏，趁她们睡着时挤了她们的奶。那个冬季大老鼠为害甚烈，据说他们跟雪球也是同伙。</p></li><li><p>这一整年，动物们干的活甚至比上一年更辛苦。重新建造风车，墙体的厚度比原先增加一倍，并且要在规定期限内完成，而农场的常规工作还得照做，这样的劳动强度可不是闹着玩儿的。有时候动物们觉得他们劳动的时间比琼斯时代更长，吃的却不比那时好。星期天上午，吱嘎总要用蹄子夹着长长一条纸，向动物们宣读大串大串的数字，表明各档粮食的产量分别增长百分之二百，百分之三百或百分之五百，因不同情况而异。动物们认为没有理由不相信他，何况他们再也记不清造反之前究竟是怎么个状况。反正有些日子他们还是感到，他们宁愿少听些数字，多得到些吃的。</p></li><li><p>但是，如果说有这样那样的艰难困苦必须忍受的话，它们也被这样一个事实部分抵消掉了：现今的生活具有比过去较多的尊严。歌声多了，讲演多了，列队游行多了。拿破仑下令每周必须举行一次名为自发性游行的活动，目的在于庆祝动物农场的斗争和胜利。所谓的自发性游行，就是动物们在指定时间放下他们的工作，编成军事化队形绕着农场的地界行进，由猪们领头，随后是马，然后是母牛，其后是绵羊，再后是家禽。狗走在队伍的两侧，而位于所有动物之首的是拿破仑的黑色小公鸡。拳击手和紫苜蓿总是合抬着标有蹄子和头角的绿色旗帜，上面还有“拿破仑同志万岁！”的字样。游行之后是为颂扬拿破仑而作的诗歌朗诵和吱嘎的演说，其中不乏最新的粮食增产数据，有时也来一下鸣枪作伴奏。绵羊们是自发性游行最热心的拥护者，如果有谁发发牢骚（只要猪或狗不在近处，个别动物有时会这样做的），说这纯粹是浪费时间，让大家在寒风中站上好半天云云，那么绵羊们肯定会以一片价来势汹汹的咩咩大合唱“四条腿好，两条腿坏！”令抱怨者闭嘴。不过，一般说来，动物们还是喜欢这类庆祝活动的。说到底他们乐意听这样的话：他们是自己真正的主人，他们干的活都是为了他们自己的福祉，等等。由于歌声嘹亮，游行队伍浩浩荡荡，吱嘎提供的一大串数字为农场增光，加之猎枪频频鸣响，小公鸡喔喔喔啼得欢畅，旗帜在猎猎声中迎风飘扬——由于身在这一切之中，动物们有可能忘却他们的肚子是空的，至少部分时间可能忘却。</p></li><li><p>现在的农场比往昔较为富裕，生产组织得也较好；它的面积有所扩大，增加了从皮尔金顿那儿购得的两块地。风车最终还是圆满建成了，农场拥有属于自己的一台脱粒机和一台捆草机，此外还新盖了各种不同的建筑物。温珀给自己购置了一辆双轮轻便马车。不过，风车到头来却并没有用于发电。它被用来碾磨谷物，收益颇丰。动物们正在努力建造另一座风车；据说等这第二座建成后将要安装发电机组。不过，当初雪球教动物们梦想过上的奢华生活——有电灯照明和冷热水齐全的厩舍，一周三天工作制——再也不谈了。拿破仑指责这种想法是与动物主义的精神背道而驰的。他说，真真正正的幸福就在于勤奋的工作和俭朴的生活。</p></li><li><p>不知怎么的，虽然农场比过去富了，可是动物们自己似乎并没有什么富裕起来的迹象——当然，猪和狗不在此例。也许，部分原因就在于有那么多的猪和那么多的狗。倒不是说这两种动物不劳动——这是他们的做派。问题在于，就像吱嘎从来不厌其烦地解释的那样，在农场的管理和组织方面有干不完的工作。这些工作中有许多属于其他动物过于无知而理解不了的。例如，吱嘎曾告诉他们，猪不得不每天耗费大量劳动在叫做“档案”、“报告”、“议事录”、“备忘录”的神秘事务上头。那都是大张大张的纸，必须在上面密密麻麻地写上字，一旦这些纸写满了字，就会放到炉子里烧掉。这对农场的福祉都是至关重要的，吱嘎说。但迄今为止，猪也罢，狗也罢，都还没有用他们自己的劳动生产过任何食物；而他们的数量却非常之多，他们的胃口又始终非常之好。</p><p>至于其他动物，据他们所知，他们的生活还一直是老样子。他们普遍吃不饱，睡干草，喝池塘水，干农活；冬天他们苦于寒冷，夏天受苍蝇骚扰。有时他们中年龄大些的，会去搜索他们模糊的记忆，试图就这样一个问题做出判断：在早先造反的日子里，那会儿琼斯被赶走还不太久，当时的日子是比现在好，还是比现在差。他们记不起来了。他们没有任何东西可以拿来同当前的生活做比较，因为他们没有任何参照的依据，除非以吱嘎的长长一大串一大串数字为准，而这些数字一贯表明任何事物都是越来越好，越来越好。动物们发现这个问题没法儿解决；他们现在没工夫思考这些事情。只有老本杰明表示自己漫长一生的每一个细节他都记得起来，也知道事情从来没有、也永远不会大大好于过去或大大不如过去——反正饥饿、辛苦和失望是生活的不变法则，他如是说。</p></li><li><p>皮尔金顿先生说，能感到很长一个时期以来的不信任和误会现已告终，这对他来说是皆大欢喜的缘由——他相信对在座的其他各位来说亦然如此。曾经有一段时间——虽然他或在座的任何一位都不认同这种态度——但确实曾有一段时间，尊敬的动物农场几位业主遭到来自他们的人类邻居的……他不愿说敌视，但或许可以说是某种程度的猜疑。不幸的事件时有发生，错误的观念被普遍接受。当时觉得，一家由猪当业主和经营管理的农场的存在，总有些不太正常，会对周边邻居产生一种不安定的影响。为数极多的农场主未做调查研究便认定，这样的农场里主宰一切的必然是无法无天、恣意胡为的歪风邪气。这些农场主十分忧虑他们自己的动物乃至他们的人类雇员会受到影响。但所有这一切疑虑如今均已消除。今天他和他的几位朋友一起来动物农场参观访问，亲眼考察了这里的每一寸土地，他们发现了什么呢？不光操作规程是最现代的，而且工作纪律严明，到处井然有序，这些对于任何地方的农场主都堪为楷模。动物农场的低等动物比郡内任何动物干的活更多，而消耗的饲料却更少——他相信自己这样说没错。确实，他和他的同行参观者们今天看到的很多东西，他们打算马上引进到自己的农场里去。<br> 他说，在发表自己这番感想的末尾，他要再一次强调，过去存在于动物农场与它邻居之间的友好感情应该继续留存下去。猪与人之间过去没有，也没有必要产生任何利害冲突。他们努力奋斗的目标和面临的困难是相同的。劳工问题在任何地方不都是一样的吗？说到这里，皮尔金顿先生显然有意向大家抛出一句精心准备好的俏皮话，然而有一瞬间他自己越想越觉得可笑，以致话也说不出来。他呛了好一阵子，在这期间他那呈多级台阶状的下巴转成了紫色，呛过以后，他总算说出了口：“你们有你们的低等动物需要对付，”他说，“我们有我们的下层阶级需要摆平！”这句妙语一出，举座为之笑得前俯后仰；于是皮尔金顿先生就他在动物农场观察到的食品定量低、工作时间长以及绝无纪律松弛现象再一次向猪们表示祝贺。</p></li><li><p>和拿破仑所有的发言一样，这次讲话也很短，而且直奔主题。他说，他对于误会误解的时期终于结束也感到很高兴。在一个长时期内有流言在传播——他有理由认为是敌人恶意散播的——说他自己以及他的同事们的观点含有某种颠覆性，甚至革命性的内容。外界认为他们图谋煽动附近几家农场的动物起来造反。没有比这种谣言离事实真相更远的了！拿破仑和他的同事们的唯一愿望，现在和过去都是同他们的邻居和睦共处，保持正常的商务关系。他补充说，他有幸负责监管的这个农场，是一个合作社性质的企业。由他亲自保管的产权证书属于猪们共有。</p><p>他说他不信旧的猜疑还会残存下来，但前不久农场在规章制度方面还是做了若干变更，这些举措应该会收到进一步推动互信的效果。到目前为止，农场的动物们有一个颇为愚蠢的惯例，就是互相称呼“同志”。这个称呼必须禁止使用。另外还有一条非常奇怪的旧规，其起因已无从查考，那就是每星期日早晨必须列队走过钉在花园内木柱上的一个公猪头颅。这一陋规也将取消，那个骷髅头已经被掩埋。来宾们可能已经看到有一面绿色旗帜飘扬在旗杆顶上。如果看到了，他们或许会留意原先标在旗帜上面的白色蹄角现在已被撤去。今后它将是一面素色的绿旗。</p></li></ol><h2 id="局外人" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#局外人" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 局外人</h2><ol><li><p>事实上，头几天我并不是真的在坐牢：我在模模糊糊等着什么新情况。直到第一次，也是唯一一次，玛丽来看我之后，一切才开始。从我收到她的信那天开始(她说她的家人不允许她再来了，因为她不是我的妻子)，我才感觉到我住的地方是牢房，我的生活到此为止了。</p></li><li><p>我等待每天在院子里的放风或者我律师的到访，其余的时间，我也安排得很好。我常常想如果让我住在一棵枯树干里，除了抬头看看头顶天空的流云，无所事事，我也会习惯的。我会等待着鸟儿飞过或者白云相会，就像我在这里等着我律师的奇怪领带，或者就像在另一个世界，我耐心地等到礼拜六，抱紧玛丽的身体一样。不过，仔细想来，我并不在一根枯树干里。还有比我更不幸的人——这其实也是妈妈的一个想法，她生前总说，到头来，人什么都能习惯。</p></li><li><p>就这样，睡觉、回忆、读我的新闻，昼夜交替，时间就过去了。我在书里读过，人最后都会失去时间概念，但是对我而言，这并没有太多意义。我始终不理解，日子为什么可以如此漫长又如此短暂。日子过起来如此漫长，这是毫无疑问的，但它们却又如此紧凑，一天推涌着一天。它们失去了自己的名字，只有“昨天”和“明天”这两个词，对我来说还剩下一些意义。</p></li><li><p>听见别人谈论自己总是很有意思的，即便是坐在被告席上听。在检察官和我的律师进行辩论时，我可以说大家对我的谈论是很多的，也许谈我比谈我的罪更多。不过，这些辩护词真的有那么大的区别吗？律师举起胳膊，说我有罪，但有可以宽恕的地方；检察官伸出双手，宣告我有罪，并且没有任何可以宽恕的借口。但是，有一件事让我隐约觉得尴尬。尽管我心里忧虑，但我偶尔也想加入进去说几句，但这种时候，我的律师就会对我说：“您别说话，这对您更有利。”从某种程度上来说，他们在处理这件案子时，把我撇在了一边。这一切都在进展着，而我不能有任何干涉。我的命运被发落，完全不征求我的意见。时不时地，我想打断所有人的话，对他们说：“追根究底，谁才是被告？被告也是很重要的。我也有话要说！”但是想来想去，我也没什么要说的。况且，我得承认，人的兴趣点总不会持续太久的。比如，检察官的控诉很快就让我厌烦了。只有那些与全局无关的只言片语、一些手势和大段独白，还能使我震惊，或者引起我的兴趣。</p></li></ol><h2

三国演义</h2><ol><li><p>朱儁(jùn)分兵四面围定，城中断粮，韩忠使人出城投降，儁不许。玄德曰：“昔高祖之得天下，盖为能招降纳顺，公何拒韩忠耶？”儁曰：“彼一时，此一时也。昔秦、项之际，天下大乱，民无定主，故招降赏附，以劝来耳。今海内一统，惟黄巾造反，若容其降，无以劝善。使贼得利恣意劫掠，失利便投降。此长寇之志，非良策也。”玄德曰：“不容寇降是矣。今四面围如铁桶，贼乞降不得，必然死战。万人一心，尚不可当，况城中有数万死命之人乎？不若撤去东南，独攻西北。贼必弃城而走，无心恋战，可即擒也。”儁然之，随撤东南二面军马，一齐攻打西北。</p></li><li><p>卓按剑立于园门，忽见一人跃马持戟，于园门外往来驰骤。卓问李儒：“此何人也？”儒曰：“此丁原义儿，姓吕名布，字奉先者也。主公且须避之。”卓乃入园潜避。次日，人报丁原引军城外搦战。卓怒，引军同李儒出迎。两阵对圆，只见吕布顶束发金冠，披百花战袍，擐(huàn)唐猊(ní)铠甲，系狮蛮宝带，纵马挺戟，随丁建阳出到阵前。建阳指卓骂曰：“国家不幸，阉官弄权，以致万民涂炭。尔无尺寸之功，焉敢妄言废立，欲乱朝廷！”董卓未及回言，吕布飞马直杀过来。董卓慌走，建阳率军掩杀，卓兵大败，退三十馀里下寨，聚众商议。卓曰：“吾观吕布非常人也。吾若得此人，何虑天下哉！”帐前一人出曰：“主公勿忧。某与吕布同乡，知其勇而无谋，见利忘义。某凭三寸不烂之舌，说吕布拱手来降，可乎？”卓大喜，观其人，乃虎贲中郎将李肃也。卓曰：“汝将何以说之？”肃曰：“某闻主公有名马一匹，号曰‘赤兔’，日行千里。须得此马，再用金珠，以利结其心。某更进说词，吕布必反丁原，来投主公矣。”卓问李儒曰：“此言可乎？”儒曰：“主公欲取天下，何惜一马！”卓欣然与之，更与黄金一千两、明珠数十颗、玉带一条。</p></li><li><p>且说董卓欲杀袁绍，李儒止之曰：“事未可定，不可妄杀。”袁绍手提宝剑，辞别百官而出，悬节东门，奔冀州去了。卓谓太傅袁隗曰：“汝侄无礼，吾看汝面，姑恕之。废立之事若何？”隗曰：“太尉所见是也。”卓曰：“敢有阻大议者，以军法从事！”群臣震恐，皆云：“一听尊命。”宴罢，卓问侍中周毖(bì)、校尉伍琼曰：“袁绍此去若何？”周毖曰：“袁绍忿忿而去，若购之急，势必为变。且袁氏树恩四世，门生故吏遍于天下，倘收豪杰以聚徒众，英雄因之而起，山东非公有也。不如赦之，拜为一郡守，则绍喜于免罪，必无患矣。”伍琼曰：“袁绍好谋无断，不足为虑，诚不若加之一郡守，以收民心。”卓从之，即日差人拜绍为渤海太守。</p></li><li><p>行了三日，至成皋地方，天色向晚。操以鞭指林深处谓宫曰：“此间有一人姓吕，名伯奢，是吾父结义弟兄，就往问家中消息，觅一宿，如何？”宫曰：“最好。”二人至庄前下马，入见伯奢。奢曰：“我闻朝廷遍行文书，捉汝甚急，汝父已避陈留去了。汝如何得至此？”操告以前事，曰：“若非陈县令，已粉骨碎身矣。”伯奢拜陈宫曰：“小侄若非使君，曹氏灭门矣。使君宽怀安坐，今晚便可下榻草舍。”说罢，即起身入内。良久乃出，谓陈宫曰：“老夫家无好酒，容往西村沽一樽来相待。”言讫，匆匆上驴而去。</p><p>操与宫坐久，忽闻庄后有磨刀之声。操曰：“吕伯奢非吾至亲，此去可疑，当窃听之。”二人潜步入草堂后，但闻人语曰：“缚而杀之，何如？”操曰：“是矣！今若不先下手，必遭擒获。”遂与宫拔剑直入，不问男女，皆杀之，一连杀死八口。搜至厨下，却见缚一猪欲杀。宫曰：“孟德心多，误杀好人矣！”急出庄上马而行。行不到二里，只见伯奢驴鞍前鞒悬酒二瓶，手携果菜而来，叫曰：“贤侄与使君何故便去？”操曰：“被罪之人，不敢久住。”伯奢曰：“吾已分付家人宰一猪相款，贤侄、使君何憎一宿？速请转骑。”操不顾，策马便行。行不数步，忽拔剑复回，叫伯奢曰：“此来者何人？”伯奢回头看时，操挥剑砍伯奢于驴下。宫大惊曰：“适才误耳，今何为也？”操曰：“伯奢到家，见杀死多人，安肯干休？若率众来追，必遭其祸矣。”宫曰：“知而故杀，大不义也！”操曰：“宁教我负天下人，休教天下人负我。”陈宫默然。</p></li><li><p>众诸侯听得关外鼓声大振，喊声大举，如天摧地塌，岳撼山崩，众皆失惊。正欲探听，鸾铃响处，马到中军，云长提华雄之头，掷于地上，其酒尚温。后人有诗赞之曰：</p><pre><code> 威镇乾坤第一功，辕门画鼓响冬冬。云长停盏施英勇，酒尚温时斩华雄。

一万两、彩缎一千匹，使夹攻刘备。布喜，令高顺领兵五万袭玄德之后。玄德闻得此信，乘阴雨撤兵，弃盱眙而走，思欲东取广陵。比及高顺军来，玄德已去。高顺与纪灵相见，就索所许之物。灵曰：“公且回军，容某见主公计之。”高顺乃别纪灵回军，见吕布具述纪灵语。布正在迟疑，忽有袁术书至。书意云：“高顺虽来，而刘备未除。且待捉了刘备，那时方以所许之物相送。”布怒，骂袁术失信，欲起兵伐之。陈宫曰：“不可。术据寿春，兵多粮广，不可轻敌。不如请玄德还屯小沛，使为我羽翼。他日令玄德为先锋，那时先取袁术，后取袁绍，可纵横天下矣。”布听其言，令人赍书迎玄德回。</p><p>却说玄德引兵东取广陵，被袁术劫寨，折兵大半。回来正遇吕布之使，呈上书札，玄德大喜。关、张曰：“吕布乃无义之人，不可信也。”玄德曰：“彼既以好情待我，奈何疑之？”遂来到徐州。布恐玄德疑惑，先令人送还家眷。甘、糜二夫人见玄德，具说吕布令兵把定宅门，禁诸人不得入；又常使侍妾送物，未尝有缺。玄德谓关、张曰：“我知吕布必不害我家眷也。”乃入城谢吕布。张飞恨吕布，不肯随往，先奉二嫂往小沛去了。玄德入见吕布拜谢，吕布曰：“吾非欲夺城，因令弟张飞在此恃酒杀人，恐有失事，故来守之耳。”玄德曰：“备欲让兄久矣。”布假意仍让玄德，玄德力辞，还屯小沛住扎。关、张心中不忿，玄德曰：“屈身守分，以待天时，不可与命争也。”吕布令人送粮米缎匹。自此两家和好，不在话下。</p></li><li><p>当日筵散，策归营寨。见术席间相待之礼甚傲，心中郁闷，乃步月于中庭。因思父孙坚如此英雄，我今沦落至此，不觉放声大哭。忽见一人自外而入，大笑曰：“伯符何故如此？尊父在日，多曾用我。君今有不决之事，何不问我，乃自哭耶！”策视之，乃丹阳故鄣人，姓朱，名治，字君理，孙坚旧从事官也。策收泪而延之坐曰：“策所哭者，恨不能继父之志耳。”治曰：“君何不告袁公路，借兵往江东，假名救吴景，实图大业，而乃久困于人之下乎？”正商议间，一人忽入曰：“公等所谋，吾已知之。吾手下有精壮百人，暂助伯符一马之力。”策视其人，乃袁术谋士，汝南细阳人，姓吕，名范，字子衡。策大喜，延坐共议。吕范曰：“只恐袁公路不肯借兵。”策曰：“吾有亡父留下传国玉玺，以为质当。”范曰：“公路欲得此久矣！以此相质，必肯发兵。”三人计议已定。次日，策入见袁术，哭拜曰：“父仇不能报，今母舅吴景，又为扬州刺史刘繇所逼。策老母家小，皆在曲阿，必将被害。策敢借雄兵数千，渡江救难省亲。恐明公不信，有亡父遗下玉玺，权为质当。”术闻有玉玺，取而视之，大喜曰：“吾非要你玉玺，今且权留在此。我借兵三千、马五百匹与你。平定之后，可速回来。你职位卑微，难掌大权。我表你为折冲校尉、殄寇将军，克日领兵便行。”</p></li><li><p>却说太史慈招得精壮二千馀人，并所部兵，正要来与刘繇报仇。孙策与周瑜商议活捉太史慈之计。瑜令三面攻县，只留东门放走，离城二十五里，三路各伏一军，太史慈到那里，人困马乏，必然被擒。原来太史慈所招军大半是山野之民，不谙纪律，泾县城头苦不甚高。当夜孙策命陈武短衣持刀，首先爬上城放火。太史慈见城上火起，上马投东门走，背后孙策引军赶来。太史慈正走，后军赶至三十里，却不赶了。太史慈走了五十里，人困马乏，芦苇之中，喊声忽起。慈急待走，两下里绊马索齐来，将马绊翻了，生擒太史慈，解投大寨。策知解到太史慈，亲自出营喝散士卒，自释其缚，将自己锦袍衣之，请入寨中，谓曰：“我知子义真丈夫也。刘繇蠢辈，不能用为大将，以致此败。”慈见策待之甚厚，遂请降。</p><p>策执慈手笑曰：“神亭相战之时，若公获我，还相害否？”慈笑曰：“未可知也。”策大笑，请入帐，邀之上坐，设宴款待。慈曰：“刘君新破，士卒离心。某欲自往收拾馀众，以助明公。不识能相信否？”策起谢曰：“此诚策所愿也。今与公约：明日日中，望公来还。”慈应诺而去。诸将曰：“太史慈此去必不来矣。”策曰：“子义乃信义之士，必不背我。”众皆未信。次日，立竿于营门以候日影。恰将日中，太史慈引一千馀众到寨。孙策大喜。众皆服策之知人。于是孙策聚数万之军下江东，安民恤众，投者无数。江东之民，皆呼策为“孙郎”。但闻孙郎兵至，皆丧胆而走。及策军到，并不许一人掳掠，鸡犬不惊，人民皆悦，赍牛酒到寨劳军。策以金帛答之，欢声遍野。其刘繇旧军，愿从军者听从，不愿为军者给赏归农。江南之民，无不仰颂。由是兵势大盛。策乃迎母叔诸弟俱归曲阿，使弟孙权与周泰守宣城。策领兵南取吴郡。</p></li><li><p>袁术曰：“计将安出？”大将曰：“刘备军屯小沛，虽然易取，奈吕布虎踞徐州。前次许他金帛粮马，至今未与，恐其助备。今当令人送与粮食，以结其心，使其按兵不动，则刘备可擒。先擒刘备，后图吕布，徐州可得也。”术喜，便具粟二十万斛，令韩胤赍密书往见吕布。吕布甚喜，重待韩胤。胤回告袁术，术遂遣纪灵为大将，雷薄、陈兰为副将，统兵数万，进攻小沛。玄德闻知此信，聚众商议。张飞要出战，孙乾曰：“今小沛粮寡兵微，如何抵敌？可修书告急于吕布。”张飞曰：“那厮如何肯来！”玄德曰：“乾之言善。”遂修书与吕布，书略曰：</p><p>伏自将军垂念，令备于小沛容身，实拜云天之德。今袁术欲报私仇，遣纪灵领兵到县，亡在旦夕，非将军莫能救。望驱一旅之师，以救倒悬之急，不胜幸甚！</p><p>吕布看了书，与陈宫计议曰：“前者袁术送粮致书，盖欲使我不救玄德也，今玄德又来求救。吾想玄德屯军小沛，未必遂能为我害。若袁术并了玄德，则北连泰山诸将以图我，我不能安枕矣，不若救玄德。”遂点兵起程。</p></li><li><p>不说玄德入小沛，吕布归徐州。却说纪灵回淮南见袁术，说吕布辕门射戟解和之事，呈上书信。袁术大怒曰：“吕布受吾许多粮米，反以此儿戏之事偏护刘备。吾当自提重兵，亲征刘备，兼讨吕布！”纪灵曰：“主公不可造次。吕布勇力过人，兼有徐州之地，若布与备首尾相连，不易图也。灵闻布妻严氏有一女，年已及笄[3]。主公有一子，可令人求亲于布。布若嫁女于主公，必杀刘备。此乃‘疏不间亲’之计也。”袁术从之，即日遣韩胤为媒，赍礼物往徐州求亲。胤到徐州见布，称说：“主公仰慕将军，欲求令爱为儿妇，永结‘秦晋之好’。”布入谋于妻严氏。原来吕布有二妻一妾：先娶严氏为正妻，后娶貂蝉为妾；及居小沛时，又娶曹豹之女为次妻。曹氏先亡无出，貂蝉亦无所出，惟严氏生一女，布最钟爱。当下严氏对布曰：“吾闻袁公路久镇淮南，兵多粮广，早晚将为天子。若成大事，则吾女有后妃之望，只不知他有几子？”布曰：“止有一子。”妻曰：“既如此，即当许之。纵不为皇后，吾徐州亦无忧矣。”布意遂决，厚款韩胤，许了亲事。韩胤回报袁术。术即备聘礼，仍令韩胤送至徐州。吕布受了，设席相待，留于馆驿安歇。</p><p>次日，陈宫竟往馆驿内拜望韩胤。讲礼毕坐定，宫乃叱退左右，对胤曰：“谁献此计，教袁公与奉先联姻？意在取刘玄德之头乎？”胤失惊，起谢曰：“乞公台勿泄！”宫曰：“吾自不泄，只恐其事若迟，必被他人识破，事将中变。”胤曰：“然则奈何？愿公教之。”宫曰：“吾见奉先，使其即日送女就亲，何如？”胤大喜，称谢曰：“若如此，袁公感佩明德不浅矣！”宫遂辞别韩胤，入见吕布曰：“闻公女许嫁袁公路，甚善。但不知于何日结亲？”布曰：“尚容徐议。”宫曰：“古者自受聘成婚之期，各有定例：天子一年，诸侯半年，大夫一季，庶民一月。”布曰：“袁公路天赐国宝，早晚当为帝，今从天子例，可乎？”宫曰：“不可。”布曰：“然则仍从诸侯例？”宫曰：“亦不可。”布曰：“然则将从卿大夫例矣？”宫曰：“亦不可。”布笑曰：“公岂欲吾依庶民例耶？”宫曰：“非也。”布曰：“然则公意欲如何？”宫曰：“方今天下，诸侯互相争雄。今公与袁公路结亲，诸侯保无有嫉妒者乎？若复远择吉期，或竟乘我良辰，伏兵半路以夺之，如之奈何？为今之计，不许便休。既已许之，当趁诸侯未知之时，即便送女到寿春，另居别馆，然后择吉成亲，万无一失也。”布喜曰：“公台之言甚当。”遂入告严氏，连夜具办妆奁，收拾宝马香车，令宋宪、魏续一同韩胤送女前去。鼓乐喧天，送出城外。</p><p>时陈元龙之父陈珪，养老在家，闻鼓乐之声，遂问左右，左右告以故。珪曰：“此乃‘疏不间亲’之计也。玄德危矣。”遂扶病来见吕布。布曰：“大夫何来？”珪曰：“闻将军死至，特来吊丧。”布惊曰：“何出此言？”珪曰：“前者袁公路以金帛送公，欲杀刘玄德，而公以射戟解之；今忽来求亲，其意盖欲以公女为质，随后就来攻玄德而取小沛。小沛亡，徐州危矣。且彼或来借粮，或来借兵。公若应之，是疲于奔命，而又结怨于人；若其不允，是弃亲而启兵端也。况闻袁术有称帝之意，是造反也。彼若造反，则公乃反贼亲属矣，得无为天下所不容乎？”布大惊曰：“陈宫误我！”急命张辽引兵，追赶至三十里之外，将女抢归，连韩胤都拿回监禁，不放归去。却令人回复袁术，只说女儿妆奁未备，俟备毕便自送来。陈珪又说吕布，使解韩胤赴许都。布犹豫未决。</p></li><li><p>却说玄德前奔许都，到城外下寨，先使孙乾来见曹操，言被吕布追逼，特来相投。操曰：“玄德与吾，兄弟也。”便请入城相见。次日，玄德留关、张在城外，自带孙乾、糜竺入见操。操待以上宾之礼。玄德备诉吕布之事。操曰：“布乃无义之辈，吾与贤弟并力诛之。”玄德称谢。操设宴相待，至晚送出。荀彧入见曰：“刘备，英雄也。今不早图，后必为患。”操不答。彧出，郭嘉入。操曰：“荀彧劝我杀玄德，当如何？”嘉曰：“不可。主公兴义兵，为百姓除暴，惟仗信义以招俊杰，犹惧其不来也。今玄德素有英雄之名，以困穷而来投，若杀之，是害贤也。天下智谋之士，闻而自疑，将裹足不前，主公谁与定天下乎？夫除一人之患，以阻四海之望，安危之机，不可不察。”操大喜曰：“君言正合吾心。”次日，即表荐刘备领豫州牧。程昱谏曰：“刘备终不为人之下，不如早图之。”操曰：“方今正用英雄之时，不可杀一人而失天下之心，此郭奉孝与吾有同见也。”遂不听昱言，以兵三千、粮万斛送与玄德，使往豫州到任，进兵屯小沛，招集原散之兵攻吕布。玄德至豫州，令人约会曹操。</p></li><li><p>却说曹兵十七万，日费粮食浩大，诸郡又荒旱，接济不及。操催军速战，李丰等闭门不出。操军相拒月馀，粮食将尽，致书于孙策，借得粮米十万斛，不敷支散。管粮官任峻部下仓官王垕入禀操曰：“兵多粮少，当如之何？”操曰：“可将小斛散之，权且救一时之急。”垕曰：“兵士倘怨，如何？”操曰：“吾自有策。”垕依命，以小斛分散。操暗使人各寨探听，无不嗟怨，皆言丞相欺众。操乃密召王垕入曰：“吾欲问汝借一物，以压众心，汝必勿吝。”垕曰：“丞相欲用何物？”操曰：“欲借汝头以示众耳。”垕大惊曰：“某实无罪！”操曰：“吾亦知汝无罪，但不杀汝，军心变矣。汝死后，汝妻子吾自养之，汝勿虑也。”垕再欲言时，操早呼刀斧手推出门外，一刀斩讫，悬头高竿，出榜晓示曰：“王垕故行小斛，盗窃官粮，谨按军法。”于是众怨始解。</p></li><li><p>却说曹操引军回许都，人报段煨杀了李傕，伍习杀了郭汜，将头来献。段煨并将李傕合族老小二百馀口活解入许都。操令分于各门处斩，传首号令，人民称快。天子升殿，会集文武，作太平筵席。封段煨为荡寇将军、伍习为殄虏将军，各引兵镇守长安，二人谢恩西去。操即奏张绣作乱，当兴兵伐之。天子乃亲排銮驾，送操出师。——时建安三年夏四月也。操留荀彧在许都，调遣兵将，自统大军进发。行军之次，见一路麦已熟，民因兵至，逃避在外，不敢刈麦。操使人远近遍谕村人父老，及各处守境官吏曰：“吾奉天子明诏，出兵讨逆，与民除害。方今麦熟之时，不得已而起兵，大小将校，凡过麦田，但有践踏者，并皆斩首。军法甚严，尔民勿得惊疑。”百姓闻谕，无不欢喜称颂，望尘遮道而拜。官军经过麦田，皆下马以手扶麦，递相传送而过，并不敢践踏。操乘马正行，忽田中惊起一鸠，那马眼生，窜入麦中，践坏了一大块麦田。操随呼行军主簿，拟议自己践麦之罪。主簿曰：“丞相岂可议罪？”操曰：“吾自制法，吾自犯之，何以服众？”即掣所佩之剑欲自刎，众急救住。郭嘉曰：“古者《春秋》之义：法不加于尊。丞相总统大军，岂可自戕？”操沉吟良久，乃曰：“既《春秋》有‘法不加于尊’之义，吾姑免死。”乃以剑割自己之发，掷于地曰：
